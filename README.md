# Stream API Study Project

## Overview

This project is a study of the Stream API in Java, showcasing the use of various functional interfaces such as `Consumer`, `Supplier`, `Function`, `Predicate`, and `BinaryOperator`. Each example is designed to demonstrate practical use cases and how these interfaces can be applied in functional programming with Java.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following classes, each representing a different functional interface:

1. **ConsumerExample.java**
    - Demonstrates the use of the `Consumer` interface to perform an action on elements of a `Stream`.
    - Example: Printing even numbers from a list.

2. **SupplierExample.java**
    - Demonstrates the use of the `Supplier` interface to generate or supply values.
    - Example: Generating a list of greetings.

3. **FunctionExample.java**
    - Demonstrates the use of the `Function` interface to transform or map elements of a `Stream`.
    - Example: Doubling the numbers in a list.

4. **PredicateExample.java**
    - Demonstrates the use of the `Predicate` interface to filter elements based on a condition.
    - Example: Filtering words with more than 5 characters.

5. **BinaryOperatorExample.java**
    - Demonstrates the use of the `BinaryOperator` interface to combine elements.
    - Example: Summing all numbers in a list.
